# Comment Locator Web Extension

A web extension for Firefox that draws a little red line next to the scrollbar
indicating how far down the page the comments are.

# Motivation

Oftentimes I'll load an article to read, and become immediately daunted at how
long it looks.  Half the time, I look at the scroll bar and how huge the article
looks!  Half the time, it turns out that there are like one or two paragraphs of
actual content and legions of commenters.  I wanted a little indicator to
give me an idea in advance about how big the article actually is.

This is something I built entirely for myself - if you find it useful, great!
But keep in mind that I'm not likely going to spend a lot of time on improving
this; that said, any contributions to improve the code are most welcome!
